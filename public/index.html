    <p>The Swedish pop star Måns Zelmerlöw is sitting in a Stockholm coffee shop explaining how his leather stage pants breathe surprisingly well. The coffee shop is at the entrance of a busy mall, yet Zelmerlöw, one of Sweden’s most familiar faces, seems unfazed by the parade of shoppers. Most of them would recognize him as a former Swedish Idol contestant and host of <em>Allsång på Skansen (Sing-Along at Skansen)</em>, a widely watched show shot in front of up to 25,000 people. It’s like Katy Perry hanging at Grand Central.</p>

    <p>“In Stockholm, people look, but they never act,” he says. Behind him, two women snap photos of the back of his head with their iPhones.</p>

    <p>It’s Wednesday, March 11, and in three days Zelmerlöw will compete in the final round of <em>Melodifestivalen</em>, or <em>Song Festival</em>. </p>

    <p>Melfest, as it is known, is a six-week televised competition that SVT, Sweden’s state-run broadcaster, has staged in various forms since 1959. Measured by its home audience, it makes <em>American Idol</em> look like a couple of people humming a tune in your living room. In recent years, reality singing franchises, including <em>The Voice</em>, <em>X Factor</em>, and <em>Pop Idol</em>, have cropped up from Australia to Britain to Ukraine. None can claim as much domestic influence as Melfest. </p>

    <p>The show airs in prime time on Saturday evenings in February and March and has been Sweden’s most watched program since 2000. It regularly claims an 80% share of TV-viewing homes, and nearly half of all Swedes hunker down in front of it. The producers have a captive audience—in February, Sweden’s coldest month, the temperature can plunge to -8 degrees F. in populous regions. The show has immense sway over the Swedish charts. In 1983, Michael Jackson’s <em>Thriller</em> was the world’s best-selling album. In Sweden that year, Melfest winner Carola Häggkvist’s debut album outsold it.</p>

    <p>Melfest, in turn, is the gateway to the Eurovision Song Contest, arguably the world’s most watched non-sporting event, with a global audience of nearly 200 million people. Former winners of Melfest (Mello, in Swedish) who went on to Eurovision include ABBA, which failed to win Melfest with “Ring, Ring” in 1973 but won both Melfest and Eurovision the following year with “Waterloo.” In 2012, Sweden’s Loreen won Eurovision, and her song, “Euphoria,” shot to the top of the charts in seven European countries. It has now been streamed more than 90 million times on Spotify, the Stockholm-based online music service.</p>

    <p>Beyond Eurovision, global superstars routinely call on Swedes for help behind the scenes. Songwriter and producer Max Martin has had 19 Billboard No. 1 hits, including Taylor Swift’s recent entries “Shake It Off” and “Blank Space.” That puts him third on the all-time record list in the U.S., behind only Paul McCartney and John Lennon. Kelly Clarkson’s “Since U Been Gone,” Britney’s “Baby One More Time,” Maroon 5’s “Moves Like Jagger,” and Katy Perry’s "I Kissed a Girl" were all written or co-written by Swedes.</p>

    <p>Swedish songwriters and producers, emboldened by ABBA’s success, started to think commercially and to sing in English, leading Ace of Base, Army of Lovers, Europe, the Hives and the Roxettes to go global. And while Swedish groups don't often become world-wide superstars, many are sensations in Europe, Japan and other markets. Sweden is the world’s third-largest exporter of pop music (by copyright revenue collected for its songwriters, publishers and composers), after the U.S. and the U.K., and the largest exporter on a per capita basis. It’s teaching us how to consume music as well: Spotify now has more than 60 million users around the world.</p>

    <p>None of this is lost on Sweden, which sees the popularity of its music as a measure of its international standing. In January, the postal service launched a series of five stamps celebrating Martin and four of its other pop exports—Avicii, First Aid Kit, Robyn, and Seinabo—for “spreading Swedish music across the world.” And there is ABBA: The Museum, in Stockholm, a 54,000-square-foot space that opened in May 2013, coinciding with Eurovision, which Sweden hosted in Malmö that year. It has a room devoted ABBA’s Melfest and Eurovision victories that includes the outlandish costumes the band wore singing “Waterloo” at the 1974 edition of Eurovision in Brighton, in the U.K.</p>

    <p>A museum of ABBA? </p>

    <p>“They have sold almost 400 million records worldwide, and Sweden only has 9 million inhabitants,” Mattias Hansson, who runs the museum, observes.</p>

    <p>Melfest brings together 28 acts—some established, some new, all of them perspiring with ambition—culled from thousands of entries every fall. Divided into four heats, they perform original songs in front of packed Swedish arenas of up to 30,000 people. The top two acts in each heat advance to the final. Another four acts advance from a “second chance” round, in which non-qualifiers battle for redemption. </p>

    <p>Those 12 performances, bound together by a pair of charming emcees (one can’t sing and doesn’t know it) and produced without inhibition, make up the event. The prize isn’t a recording contract—most acts already have one, or expect one to follow. Instead, the winner earns the right to represent Sweden at Eurovision in May.</p>

    <p>Unlike <em>The Voice</em> or <em>X Factor</em>, Melfest’s acts perform songs that have never been heard before, rather than covers, opening up a wide revenue stream for songwriters and artists. With record sales down, that's a boon to the writers, who are “bleeding,” says Aleena Gibson. Gibson has worked with Nick Carter, S Club 7, and Jason Derulo and has two songs in this year’s final. </p>

    <p>Record labels such as Warner Music and Sony work to get their acts in the contest. “There’s an immediate and measurable response, and we can use the data to develop marketing campaigns to drive fans to new music and help people discover more of an artist’s catalogue,” says Jonas Silijemark, Warner Music’s Nordic CEO. “After last year’s Melodifestivalen final, our acts had five singles in the top 10 on the official singles chart.”</p>

    <p>Melfest “brings a little bit of glamour to those dark February evenings,” says Svante Stockselius, a former executive of SVT who overhauled the show in 2002. And it leaves the competition shaken. “All the other TV channels just lay down flat and do not air new programs,” Stockselius says. During Melfest’s time slot this year, TV4, Sweden’s largest commercial channel, is airing <em>Tricked</em>, a British show in which a magician plays pranks on B-list celebrities. The week after Melfest, TV4 will return to its own programming, airing its version of <em>American Gladiators</em>.</p>

    <p>As for Zelmerlöw, of <em>Sing-Along at Skansen</em> fame, victory has proved elusive. In 2007, he came in third with a generic dance song, “Cara Mia,” which went double platinum and spent four weeks at No. 1. Two years later, he returned with another upbeat track, “Hope and Glory,” backed by six female dancers in black hot pants. He led halfway through the voting, and cameras caught his shocked expression when he ultimately came in fourth, losing out to an opera singer performing a dance track in falsetto. He sees Melfest as a reboot. </p>

    

    <p>“During these six weeks, the hysteria is huge,” Zelmerlöw says. “Melodifestivalen is the perfect way to do a comeback.” </p>

    <p>He enters the final as the bookies’ favorite, with odds of 5 to 4, for his song “Heroes,” an insistent, repetitious electro anthem. “I’ve always said that one of my greatest dreams is to go to the Eurovision for Sweden, so of course that’s my goal, that’s my hope,” he says. “If I don’t place top three, I would probably be disappointed. Second or third, I would think that was OK.” </p>


        <p>He thinks about it. “First would be amazing.” </p>

        <p>It would be even more amazing if Jon Henrik Fjällgren won. </p>

        <p>Fjällgren has a voice and a backstory. Born in an Indian village in Colombia, he wound up in an orphanage at six months of age, and a Swedish couple soon adopted him. Members of the indigenous Sami community, they took him home to Mittådalen, a reindeer foraging area in northern Sweden, where the community tends a herd of 350. In Sweden, where the majority of the population remains pale to pink, the darker-skinned Fjällgren stands out, both among Swedes and among his adopted Sami community.</p>


        <p>He was bullied but found strength in interpreting the <em>joik</em>, a Sami musical tradition similar to the chanting of Native Americans. During his semi-final, he chanted while wearing traditional dress, and bloggers drew crass comparisons to the animated film <em>Pocahontas</em>. His chant has no words, just “emotional sounds,” says Fjällgren, 27. Behind him, three backup singers were raised to the sky dressed as angels.</p>

        <p>Some news media interpreted the airborne backup singers as the demons of his past. When he was 20, six of his closest friends died, some from suicide, some from illness. Fjällgren says he developed uncontrollable nosebleeds and contemplated taking his own life. Music became a form of therapy. “Daniel, my friend, he said to me before he died that with my music I can be a big artist,” he says. “I believed in it and tried my wings.”</p>

        <p>During his audition for <em>Sweden’s Got Talent</em>, he spoke of his long days tending to his reindeer and made the judges cry with a <em>joik</em> devoted to Daniel. As he progressed on the show, he received Facebook messages from Sami, Eskimos, Indians, and other indigenous people around the world. He went on to win the prize of a million kronor (nearly $120,000).</p>

        <p>Of the other songs in the Melfest final, he says, “Nothing new. It’s music that you hear on the radio all the time.” </p>

        <p>If Fjällgren is the maverick and Zelmerlöw the studiously modest product of media training, fan-girl favorite Eric Saade is Zelmerlöw’s cheeky foil. “This business can be pretty plastic,” Saade says. “People very often lose their personalities. But I didn't want to do that.”</p>

        <p>He hasn’t. Take #dpov, the Instagram hashtag he coined that spread like wildfire among his 103,000 followers and beyond. It stands for “dick point of view” and refers to images he takes from that thoughtful vantage point. Or his Melfest entry, “Sting,” which is already charting at No. 6, ahead of the final. On the pop-funk track, he sings, poignantly, about guys who want to be him but can’t.</p>

        <p>One of Saade’s many breaks came when Fredrik Kempe, a legendary writer with 18 songs in the final round in the past decade, spotted him at a Stockholm restaurant in 2009. At the time, Saade was part of a fledgling boy band called What’s Up! and was dating pop star and Melfest alum Molly Sandén.</p>

        <p>“I looked to the entrance and there was Molly and Eric,” Kempe says. “It wasn’t her changing the ambiance at that moment. I turned to my friend and said, ‘Do you realize that a star just entered the room?’ ”</p>


        <p>A few months later, Kempe wrote Saade a song called “Manboy” with only five notes, and Saade advanced to the final of Melfest 2010. At the climax of the performance, a shower drenched him. He came in third. The song topped the charts and stayed in the Top 60 for 33 weeks. “It was everything,” Saade says. “It launched my career here in Sweden.”</p>

        <p>They returned the following year with “Popular,” a song with many more notes, and won it all. Saade then came in third at Eurovision, behind contestants from Azerbaijan and Italy.</p>

        <p>Saade accepts that Zelmerlöw is the favorite.</p>

        <p>“ ‘Sting’ might be a little bit more catchy, but ‘Heroes’ is a great tune,” he admits. “If he wins, I'm totally going to be happy for him. I already won one time and he hasn't.”</p>

        <p>Melfest is probably the most expensive program on Swedish television. SVT, the state-run broadcaster, produces the show itself. It doesn’t disclose how much it spends, or how much it earns from sponsors. The <em>Aftonbladet</em> newspaper recently reported that Melfest generates revenue of about $14 million, consistent with earlier tallies. The singers and their labels can help finance a pricey song. One of the more elaborate acts reportedly cost $30,000. SVT declined to comment on the reports. </p>

        <p>Melfest producer Christer Björkman says that this year he received roughly 2,500 song submissions, which come with an artist attached, though SVT reserves the right to reassign songs to artists it prefers. A jury of 16 people—eight men and eight women between 20 and 60 years old, half professional, half fans of the show—listened and rated them, and their top 13 made it to the live shows. The jury pinpoints the broadest possible hits, which cut across all demographics. Björkman fills the remaining spots with oddities and celebrities that will make for good TV. This year, he has Hasse Andersson, a 67-year-old Swedish country-folk singer, and Samir &amp; Viktor, a reality TV star and a fashion blogger before Björkman chose them for the show. </p>

        <p>“The entire industry is saying, ‘What are they doing here? They are not singers. They come from a soap opera,’ ” Björkman says. “Well, people like them. We live with the fact that Melodifestivalen is like a soap opera. We go on for six weeks and have to feed the media with controversy.”</p>

        <p>In the early 1980s, Björkman ran a hair salon, eventually finding his way to music. He won Melfest in 1992 with "I morgon är en annan dag," or “Tomorrow Is Another Day.” At Eurovision he competed in a boxy black suit, deployed a flourish of jazz hands, and came in second to last. By 2002 he found himself helping cull songs for Sweden and slowly worked his way up the ranks. The papers have sometimes described him as a power-hungry despot or a sort of Godfather. He has the power to make careers through Melfest, and to stall them through exclusion.</p>

        <p>Pop stars and record labels now spend a lot of time trying to get on Björkman’s good side. But Melfest hasn’t always had that pull.</p>

        <p>“I saw the show 2001 in Malmö and it was a disaster,” says Stockselius, the former SVT executive. The show consisted mostly of no-name artists singing traditional Swedish folk-dance music. “Even though the ratings were OK, I could really see this patient was going to die,” he says.</p>

        <p>When Stockselius took charge the following year, he decided to overhaul the program, drawing inspiration from professional sports and recasting Melfest as a tournament like the World Cup. He added four semi-finals and the second-chance round, and staged them on consecutive weekends in Växjö, Norrköping, Sundsvall, Falun and Stockholm to get the whole country involved. On the night of the final, held in Stockholm’s Globe Arena, more than 40% percent of the population watched Afro-dite, a trio of black singers, shimmy to victory.</p>

        <p>On Thursday morning, Björkman stands on the stage of Stockholm’s Friends Arena. Wrinkled and hip in black and gray, he looks like the reformed pop star he is. One by one, the 12 finalists march into a sunburst of flashing camera bulbs. They stay there until Björkman tells them to move. </p>

        <p>By Friday, the Swedish media are giving Melodifestivalen front-page billing. <em>Expressen</em> publishes an image of Saade and Zelmerlöw poised to hug, or choke, each other. It describes Saade as “cocky” and Zelmerlöw as “a mother’s dream.” </p>


        <p>Another article quotes Zelmerlöw defending his songwriters. “Heroes,” it seems, is reminiscent of the French DJ and producer David Guetta’s song “Lovers on the Sun,” so reminiscent that Zelmerlöw’s songwriters are accused of ripping it off. They deny it. Earlier in the week, his rival Saade magnanimously pooh-poohed the charges, suggesting merely that the issue could taint Zelmerlöw, and all of Sweden, if the song advanced to Eurovision. </p>

        <p>The bookies take Fjällgren, the reindeer shepherd, as an outside bet against Zelmerlöw, at 11 to 2.</p>

        <p>The night of the show, more than 30,000 people file into Friends Arena. They’re dressed to dazzle, with sequined hats and pink boas. Another 3.8 million Swedes are watching at home. Zelmerlöw’s “Heroes” sits at No. 2 on the Swedish singles charts, just behind Rihanna and ahead of Ellie Goulding. On the album charts, Fjällgren’s 2014 release “Goeksegh” has climbed back to No. 2, just behind Sam Smith and ahead of Ariana Grande, Maroon 5 and Madonna.</p>

        <p>Saade, dressed in white from head to toe, looks like a louche waiter, and takes flight in a spaceship that shoots pyrotechnics. Zelmerlöw, wearing a top just tight enough to show the curves of his biceps, bends and poses dramatically while stick figures, digitally projected behind him, mimic his moves. Fjällgren’s performance oozes the same spirituality that brought him to the final. During the bridge, as fake snow falls around him, he kneels, looks straight into the camera and says, “I am free. Sweden, this <em>joik</em> is for you.”</p>

        <p>An international jury, consisting of music professionals from 11 countries, including Armenia, Estonia, and Malta, accounts for half the final score. As they announce their verdicts one by one, Zelmerlöw builds up an enormous lead, with nine of the 11 juries ranking him first. The United Kingdom throws its support behind Fjällgren, while Israel goes for Mariette, a singer who, in 2010, won the prestigious Homo of the Year ((THAT’S THE NAME?)) award from QX Magazine. Members of the public can vote a maximum of 80 times from each telephone subscription, at $1.40 a vote, most of the proceeds going to charity.</p>

    

        <p>By the end of the evening, SVT has received more than 1.5 million votes. A staggering 545,601 of them, or 35 percent, go to Zelmerlöw, who wins in a landslide. Fjällgren rakes in 19 percent to come in second, while Saade musters only 6 percent. He finishes fifth, behind the aging crooner Hasse Andersson.</p>

        <p>Fjällgren looks on from just a few feet away as photographers snap Zelmerlöw raising the winner’s trophy on stage.</p>

        <p>“This is a little too hard for me,” Fjällgren says. “I long for nature and all animals. I am rootless if I'm not in the mountains, and then I'm lost. I can be away for some time, but then I need to return home.”</p>

        <p>As part of his Melodifestivalen preparations, Zelmerlöw has cut down on alcohol and gone on a special diet of cottage cheese and berries. He’s added eight pounds of muscle. He celebrates by eating a pastry backstage.</p>

        <p>Now the real work now begins. All 40 countries competing at Eurovision 2015 have selected their artists and songs, and the campaign—replete with glossy music videos, media interviews, and concerts across Europe—is in full swing. Latvia has elected to send Aminata Savadogo, perhaps the only singer in Riga who can trace her roots to the African nation of Burkina Faso. In Finland, tele-voters chose Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivä, a heavy metal band whose members all have Down syndrome. In Poland, the state broadcaster bypassed a national selection contest and instead executives chose to send Monika Kuszynska, a songstress who was left paraplegic following a car accident in 2006. Like so many others, she’ll sing about love.</p>

        <p>Zelmerlöw, the son of a professor and a surgeon, may lack their dramatic personal stories, but he comes with a pop-obsessed nation behind him and a mainstream song that sticks in the head like a hatchet. A few days after the show, and for the first time since 2007, he reaches No. 1, leaving Rihanna, Kanye West and Paul McCartney behind.</p>
